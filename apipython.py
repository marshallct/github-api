#Try to find account activity as a %, measure how many days since account creation has there been contributions

#Go through commits, see what changes they have made (file name extensions) to see which langauge they have used
#Change format of datetime
#Write program that takes name of developer, construct url to get account information, display certain amount of information
#Write in account name, gives back account name and age
#Do the same calculation as langauges, but instead use commit history to find commit files changes, using file name extension
#How often certain files (.py, etc) appear, count the appearance of each, show all languages used in a repository
#Try to create a function from the code
#Find languages used in a certain time block, report frequency of file changes, count the frequency of a file ending
#How many languages a repository uses, return account of amount of each language
#Turn this into a function, gives data about a repository
#Use this to go over larger repositories

#With this, find how many languages a developer uses
#Can use this to find more interesting data, age, geography, etc.
#Can find list of developers with certain criteria
#Try to run code against something bigger (D3, other stuff larger than github api)
#Add trace statements, printouts (show progress, every 1000 commit output the fact you've done it), debugger
